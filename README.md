# Anti-Tivo License (ATL) v1.0  
**Copyright © cppfastio 2025**

## Background  
The concept of **Tivoization** was first introduced by the **Free Software Foundation (FSF)** to describe a practice where manufacturers **use free software but restrict users from modifying it**. The term originates from **TiVo**, a digital video recorder company that used **Linux and GNU software** but implemented hardware restrictions to prevent users from running modified versions.  

FSF responded to this issue by introducing **GPLv3**, which explicitly prohibits Tivoization. However, while FSF focuses primarily on **open-source software**, our goal with **ATL** is broader: **we prioritize openness over just open-source**.  

## What ATL Stands For  
**ATL is NOT against commercial use—it is against the loss of basic device rights.**  
Every user should have the ability to **install, modify, and run software freely**, without platform-imposed limitations. ATL enforces the following principles to **protect user and developer rights**:

### 1. Preventing Tivoization  
- If a device includes an **app store**, it **must** allow users to install modified versions of software **without restrictions**.  
- Manufacturers **must not** use cryptographic locks or hardware verifications to prevent users from modifying and reinstalling software.  

### 2. Prioritizing Cross-Platform Technologies  
- Whenever **PWA (Progressive Web Applications)** or **Wine** is viable, developers and manufacturers **should prioritize** them to ensure openness and portability.  
- If a platform **intentionally disrupts open internet browsing** (e.g., restricting **PWA functionality** for monopoly reasons), all software on that platform **must** be licensed under **GPLv3**, ensuring users’ full modification and installation rights.  

### 3. Exemptions
No devices are exemptions. Not even medical devices. 

### 4. Enforcement & Non-Mandatory Action  
- The license holder **reserves the right** to enforce ATL but is **not obligated** to do so.  
- Enforcement actions **may** be taken against platforms engaging in **Tivoization** or **deliberately undermining open internet access**.  
- This license is **not subject to any government regulations**, including but not limited to the U.S. government.  

## Refuting Apple's Sideloading Arguments  
Apple has repeatedly justified its **ban on sideloading** with security concerns, particularly in its report *"Building a Trusted Ecosystem for Millions of Apps: A Threat Analysis of Sideloading"*. Apple argues that sideloading would:  
1. **Increase malware risks** by allowing users to install applications from unverified sources.  
2. **Reduce user security and privacy** by bypassing App Store protections.  
3. **Encourage fraud** by making it easier for malicious apps to impersonate legitimate ones.  

However, these claims are **misleading** and **ignore obvious solutions** that preserve both security and openness:  

- **Sideloading Can Be an Opt-In Feature**  
  Apple could simply offer **an "Open Mode"** that allows experienced users to install apps freely.

- **Malware Prevention Is Possible Without App Store Monopolies**  
  Operating systems already have **built-in security features** like sandboxing, app permissions, and malware detection. Apple’s insistence on banning sideloading **is a business decision, not a technical necessity**.  

- **Restricted PWA Support Is a Sign of Monopoly, Not Security**  
  Apple also limits Progressive Web Applications (**PWA**) on iOS, forcing developers into its App Store instead of allowing truly **cross-platform**, **open** web apps. If Apple were truly committed to user choice, **PWA would be fully supported** rather than crippled.  

## Why ATL Matters  
Software freedom isn’t just about open-source—it’s about **the fundamental right to use your own device**.  
ATL ensures developers can **protect their projects from being locked into proprietary ecosystems**, while giving users the ability to **control their own hardware and software**—something that should never have been taken
