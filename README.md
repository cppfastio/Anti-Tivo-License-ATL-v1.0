# Anti-Tivo License (ATL) v1.0  
**Copyright © cppfastio 2025**

## Background  
The concept of **Tivoization** was first introduced by the **Free Software Foundation (FSF)** to describe a practice where manufacturers **use free software but restrict users from modifying it**. The term originates from **TiVo**, a digital video recorder company that used **Linux and GNU software** but implemented hardware restrictions to prevent users from running modified versions.  

FSF responded to this issue by introducing **GPLv3**, which explicitly prohibits Tivoization. However, while FSF focuses primarily on **open-source software**, our goal with **ATL** is broader: **we prioritize openness over just open-source**.  

## What ATL Stands For  
**ATL is NOT against commercial use—it is against the loss of basic device rights.**  
Every user should have the ability to **install, modify, and run software freely**, without platform-imposed limitations. ATL enforces the following principles to **protect user and developer rights**:

### 1. Preventing Tivoization  
- If a device includes an **app store**, it **must** allow users to install modified versions of software **without restrictions**.  
- Manufacturers **must not** use cryptographic locks or hardware verifications to prevent users from modifying and reinstalling software.  

### 2. Prioritizing Cross-Platform Technologies  
- Whenever **PWA (Progressive Web Applications)** or **Wine** is viable, developers and manufacturers **should prioritize** them to ensure openness and portability.  
- If a platform **intentionally disrupts open internet browsing** (e.g., restricting **PWA functionality** for monopoly reasons), all software on that platform **must** be licensed under **GPLv3**, ensuring users’ full modification and installation rights.  

### 3. Exemptions for Critical Systems  
- **Medical Equipment** and **Automotive Systems** are exempt from modification restrictions to ensure safety and reliability.  

### 4. Enforcement & Non-Mandatory Action  
- The license holder **reserves the right** to enforce ATL but is **not obligated** to do so.  
- Enforcement actions **may** be taken against platforms engaging in **Tivoization** or **deliberately undermining open internet access**.  
- This license is **not subject to any government regulations**, including but not limited to the U.S. government.  

## Why ATL Matters  
Software freedom isn’t just about open-source—it’s about **the fundamental right to use your own device**.  
ATL ensures developers can **protect their projects from being locked into proprietary ecosystems**, while giving users the ability to **control their own hardware and software**—something that should never have been taken away.
